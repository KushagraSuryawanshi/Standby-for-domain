      <h2>Just Read This.</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t really know how to begin this, because even now, part of me is scared to say it out loud.  
        But I’ve carried this for a while, and I just need to let it out — once.
        <br><br>
        We worked together just three days ago. And even though it was brief, even though we barely spoke, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you since.  
        I thought keeping distance for weeks would help me move on. That maybe time and space would quiet whatever this was for me.  
        But it didn’t. It only made it harder. It made me realize how much I still cared, how much I still wished something was different.
        <br><br>
        I tried to act like I was fine, like I was chill and unaffected.  
        I told myself to just be nonchalant. But that’s not me.  
        Not when it comes to you.  
        <br><br>
        Maybe you never felt anything. Maybe I wasn’t your type, or maybe you just didn’t want anything at all — and that’s okay.  
        You never owed me anything, and I’m not here to change your mind.  
        <br><br>
        But the truth is, I felt something. And I didn’t know what to do with it.  
        That’s why I asked not to be rostered with you anymore.  
        It wasn’t to be dramatic — it was just me trying to protect myself from falling deeper into something that felt one-sided.  
        I thought it would help me move on. But I couldn’t stop thinking about you, even then.
        <br><br>
        I could’ve messaged you. I wrote so many things, then deleted them.  
        But I didn’t want to show up in your inbox and make things weird.  
        So I made this — quiet, private, anonymous. Just for you.
        <br><br>
        If you still don’t feel the same way, or if this really meant nothing to you… that’s okay.  
        Just unfollow me on Instagram. I’ll understand. I’ll unfollow too.  
        We’ll part ways without questions or pressure.
        <br><br>
        But if there’s anything — anything you ever felt, or anything you still want to say — please say it now.  
        This message isn’t public. It’s just for you. You don’t need to put your name.  
        Only you could unlock this, and no one else will ever see it.
        <br><br>
        Please, don’t tell anyone at work about this. I’m trusting you with something very real.  
        I’m not trying to create drama — just being honest the only way I know how.
        <br><br>
        So please… say something. Anything. Even a word. Even if it’s messy or blunt or unfinished.  
        You can write here as many times as you need to. I’ll read all of it.  
        Just don’t let it go completely silent.  
        Not again.
      </p>
